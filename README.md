# TrustNetworks
Implemented a social network containing trust relationships between users in a matrix using a 2-D Vector. Ensured the relationships were reflexive, symmetric and transitive in order to extract equivalence classes containing all the users that trust each other.

'''What I learned'''

Used find function in algorithms library to check for duplicate equivalence classes when printing out each one.

Implemented a variety of nested for and while loops to ensure reflexive, symmetric, and transitive closure.

Used input redirection to read number of users and trust relationships from text file.
